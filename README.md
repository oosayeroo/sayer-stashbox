# qb-stashbox

a simple job and gang stash solution for all employees not just bosses
i used some code from qb-management to create a job storage and gang storage script that lets all employees have access to 4 storage inventories. 
this will run alongside qb-management but is not a dependency and will work fine without it. 

## Dependencies
- [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
- [qb-input](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-input)
- [qb-menu](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-menu)
- [qb-inventory](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-inventory)

## Credits
- qb-management for the the code i used to make this
- AndyaUK for his inital idea to make something like this.

## Installation
### Manual
- Download the script and put it in the `[qb]` directory.

## ToDo List
-figure out why drawtext stays sometimes after leaving menu
